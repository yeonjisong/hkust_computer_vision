## Assignment 3
**Image Captioning, Network Visualization, Style Transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks**
* Understand and implement both Vanilla RNNs and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs.
* Understand how to sample from an RNN language model at test-time.
* Understand how to combine convolutional neural nets and recurrent nets to implement an image captioning system.
* Understand how a trained convolutional network can be used to compute gradients with respect to the input image.
* Implement and different applications of image gradients, including saliency maps, fooling images, class visualizations.
* Understand and implement style transfer.
* Understand how to train and implement a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce images that look like a dataset.
